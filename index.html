            The Asian Conference on Advance Manufacturing is the region’s first
            major event dedicated to additive manufacturing. With the theme
            “From Prototypes to Progress: Advancing Innovation with Additive
            Manufacturing,” it brings together experts, innovators, researchers,
            and industry leaders to showcase breakthroughs, applications, and
            opportunities driving industrial growth. Over two days, participants
            will explore emerging trends, advanced materials, large-scale
            production, prototyping, and sustainable practices through keynotes,
            technical sessions, panels, and networking — fostering collaboration
            and accelerating the adoption of transformative technologies across
            Asia.
